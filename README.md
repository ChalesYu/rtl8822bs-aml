### DKMS
This driver can be installed using DKMS. DKMS is a system utility which will automatically recompile and install a kernel module when a new kernel is installed. To make use of DKMS, install the `dkms` package, which on Debian (based) systems such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint is done like this:
```
$ sudo apt-get install dkms
```

### Installation of the Driver
Open a terminal in the directory with the source code and execute the following command:
```
$ sudo ./dkms-install.sh
```
```
$ sudo reboot
```
### Removal of the Driver
Open a terminal in the directory with the source code and execute the following command:
```
$ sudo ./dkms-remove.sh
```
```
$ sudo reboot
```
### Secure Mode:

- If your system is in Secure Mode and all is well, DKMS will handle signing the driver. 

### Entering Monitor Mode with 'iw' and 'ip':
Start by making sure the system recognizes the Wi-Fi interface:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

The output shows the Wi-Fi interface name and the current mode among other things. The interface name will be something like `wlx00c0cafre8ba` and is required for the below commands. I will use `wlan0` as the interface name but you need to substitute your interface name.

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```

Set monitor mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control
```

Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

### Reverting to Managed Mode with 'iw' and 'ip':

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```

Set managed mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set type managed
```

Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```
