### Installation Information

The installation instructions are for the novice user. Experienced users are welcome to alter the installation to meet their needs.

Temporary internet access is required for installation. There are numerous ways to enable temporary internet access depending on your hardware and situation. [One method is to use tethering from a phone.](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-tether-your-smartphone-in-linux)

Another method to enable temporary internet access is to keep an [ultra cheap wifi adapter that uses an in-kernel driver](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-wifi.html) in your toolkit.

You will need to use the terminal interface. The quick way to open a terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T (hold down on the Ctrl and Alt keys then press the T key)

DKMS is used for the installation. DKMS is a system utility which will automatically recompile and install this driver when a new kernel is installed. DKMS is provided by and maintained by Dell.

It is recommended that you do not delete the driver directory after installation as the directory contains information and scripts that you may need in the future.

### Installation Steps

Step 1: Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)

Step 2: Update the system (select the option for the OS you are using)
```
    Option for Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint and the Raspberry Pi OS
    
    $ sudo apt-get update
```
```
    Option for Arch based distributions such as Manjaro

    $ sudo pacman -Syu
```
Step 3: Install the required packages (select the option for the OS you are using)
```
    Option for Raspberry Pi OS

    $ sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers bc build-essential dkms git
```
```
    Option for LMDE (Debian based)

    $ sudo apt-get install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms git
```
```
    Option for Linux Mint or Ubuntu (all flavors)

    $ sudo apt-get install -y dkms git
```
```
    Option for Arch based distributions such as Manjaro

    $ sudo pacman -S --noconfirm linux-headers dkms git
```
Step 4: Create a directory to hold the downloaded driver

```bash
$ mkdir src
```
Step 5: Move to the newly created directory
```bash
$ cd ~/src
```
Step 6: Download the driver
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/morrownr/88x2bu.git
```
Step 7: Move to the newly created driver directory
```bash
$ cd ~/src/88x2bu
```
Step 8: Run a preparation script if required (Raspberry Pi *hardware* requires a preparation script)
```
    Option for 32 bit operating systems to be installed to Raspberry Pi hardware

    $ sudo ./raspi32.sh
```
```
    Option for 64 bit operating systems to be installed to Raspberry Pi hardware

    $ sudo ./raspi64.sh
```
Step 9: Run the installation script
```bash
$ sudo ./install-driver.sh
```
Step 10: Reboot
```bash
$ sudo reboot
```

### Driver Options

A file called `88x2bu.conf` will be installed in `/etc/modeprob.d` by default.

`/etc/modprobe.d/88x2bu.conf`

This file will be read and applied to the driver on each system boot.

To edit the driver options file, run the `edit-options.sh` script.
```bash
$ sudo ./edit-options.sh
```
The driver options are as follows

 -----

 Log level options ( rtw_drv_log_level )
```
 0 = NONE (default)
 1 = ALWAYS
 2 = ERROR
 3 = WARNING
 4 = INFO
 5 = DEBUG
 6 = MAX
```
 Note: You can save a log of RTW log entries by running the following in a terminal:

 $ sudo ./save-log.sh

 -----

 LED control options ( rtw_led_ctrl )
```
 0 = Always off
 1 = Normal blink (default)
 2 = Always on
```
 -----

 VHT enable options ( rtw_vht_enable )
```
  0 = Disable
  1 = Enable (default)
  2 = Force auto enable (use caution)
```
 Notes:
 - Unless you know what you are doing, don't change the default for rtw_vht_enable.
 - A non-default setting can degrade performance greatly in some operational modes.
 - For AP mode, such as when you are using Hostapd, setting this option to 2 will
   allow 80 MHz channel width.

 -----

  Power saving options ( rtw_power_mgnt )
```
 0 = Disable power saving
 1 = Power saving on, minPS (default)
 2 = Power saving on, maxPS
```
 Note: 0 may be useful in unattended server setups or if dropouts are experienced.

 -----

 USB mode options ( rtw_switch_usb_mode )
```
 0 = No switch (default)
 1 = Switch from usb 2.0 to usb 3.0
 2 = Switch from usb 3.0 to usb 2.0
```
 Note: When changing USB options, a cold boot is recommended.

 -----

### Information about USB 3 support

USB 3 support is off by default as there can be problems with older USB 3 ports, however, almost all USB 3 ports on modern systems work well so turning USB 3 support on should work fine for almost everyone and the difference in performance can be large.

See what your USB mode is:

```bash
$ lsusb -t
```
```
USB 2 =  480 Mb/s
USB 3 = 5000 Mb/s
```

### Removal of the Driver

Step 1: Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)

Step 2: Move to the driver directory
```bash
$ cd ~/src/88x2bu
```
Step 3: Run the removal script
```bash
$ sudo ./remove-driver.sh
```
Step 4: Reboot
```bash
$ sudo reboot
```
### Recommended Router Settings for WiFi

Note: These are general recommendations based on years of experience but may not apply to your situation so testing to see if any help fix your problem is recommended.

Security: Use WPA2-AES. Do not use WPA or WPA2 mixed mode or TKIP.

Channel Width for 2.4G: Use 20 MHz fixed width. Do not use 40 MHz or 20/40 automatic.

Channel width for 5G: Using a 40 MHz fixed width may help in some situations.

Channels for 2.4G: Use 1 or 6 or 11. Do not use automatic channel selection.

Mode for 2.4G: Use G/N or B/G/N. Do not use N only.

Network names: Do not set the 2.4G Network and the 5G Network to the same name. Note: Many routers come with both networks set to the same name.

Power Saving: Set to off. This can help in some situations. If you try turning it off and you see no improvement then set it back to on so as to save electricity.

After making these changes, reboot the router.


### Set regulatory domain to correct setting in OS

Check the current setting
```bash
$ sudo iw reg get
```

If you get 00, that is the default and may not provide optimal performance.

Find the correct setting here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

Set it temporarily
```bash
$ sudo iw reg set US
```
Note: Substitute your country code if you are not in the United States.

Set it permanently
```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/default/crda

Change the last line to read:

REGDOMAIN=US
```

### Recommendations regarding USB

- If connecting your USB WiFi adapter to a desktop computer, use the USB ports on the rear of the computer. Why? The ports on the rear are directly connected to the motherboard which will reduce problems with interference and disconnection that can happen with front ports that use cables.

- If your USB WiFi adapter is USB 3 capable then you need to plug it into a USB 3 port.

- If you use an extension cable and your adapter is USB 3 capable, the cable needs to be USB 3 capable.

- Some USB WiFi adapters require considerable electrical current and push the capabilities of the power available via USB port. One example is devices that use the Realtek 8814au chipset. Using a powered multiport USB extension can be a good idea in cases like this.
