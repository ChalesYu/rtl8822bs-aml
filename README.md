### Installation of the Driver:

Note: The installation instructions that are provided are for the novice user. Experienced users are welcome to alter the installation to meet their needs.

Note: The installation instructions require that your system has access to the internet. There are numerous ways to enable temporary internet access depending on your hardware and situation.

Note: The installation instructions require the use of the terminal. The quick way to open a terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T (hold down on the Ctrl and Alt keys then press the T key.)

Note: The installation instructions make use of DKMS. DKMS is a system utility which will automatically recompile and install this kernel module when a new kernel is installed. DKMS is provided by and maintained by Dell.

Note: It is recommended that you do not delete the driver directory after installation as the directory contains documentation (README.md) and scripts that you may need in the future.

Step 1: Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)

Step 2: Update the system:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
Step 3: Install the required packages: (select the option for the OS you are using)

Option for Raspberry Pi OS:
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers bc build-essential dkms git
```
Option for LMDE (Debian based):
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms git
```
Option for Linux Mint or Ubuntu:
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y dkms git
```
Step 4: Create a directory to hold the downloaded driver:

Note: The technique used in this document is to create a directory in the home directory called `src`.
```
$ mkdir src
```
Step 5: Move to the newly created directory:
```
$ cd ~/src
```
Step 6: Download the driver:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/morrownr/88x2bu.git
```
Step 7: Move to the newly created driver directory:
```
$ cd ~/src/88x2bu
```
Step 8: Run the installation script and reboot: (select the option for the OS you are using)

Option for LMDE, Linux Mint or Ubuntu:

Run installation script and reboot:
```
$ sudo ./install-driver.sh
$ sudo reboot
```
Note: The installation for LMDE, Linux Mint or Ubuntu is complete.

Option for Raspberry Pi OS: (select either Option 1 or Option 2 but not both)

Turn off I386 support:
```
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = y/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n/g' Makefile
```
Option 1: for Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit), turn on ARM support:
```
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = n/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = y/g' Makefile
```
Option 2: for Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit), turn on ARM64 support:
```
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM64_RPI = n/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM64_RPI = y/g' Makefile
```
Run installation script and reboot:
```
$ sudo ./install-driver.sh
$ sudo reboot
```
Note: The installation for Raspberry Pi OS is complete.

### Removal of the Driver:

Step 1: Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)

Step 2: Move to the driver directory:
```
$ cd ~/src/88x2bu
```
Step 3: Run the removal script and reboot:
```
$ sudo ./remove-driver.sh
$ sudo reboot
```

### Driver Options:

A file called `88x2bu.conf` will be installed in `/etc/modeprob.d` by default.

Location: `/etc/modprobe.d/88x2bu.conf`

This file will be read and applied to the driver on each system boot.

To change the driver options, there are two options:

Option 1: Edit `88x2bu.conf` with a text editor using a terminal interface.

Example:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/88x2bu.conf
```
Option 2: From the driver directory, run the `./edit-options.sh` script:
```
$ sudo ./edit-options.sh
```
The driver options are as follows:


USB mode options: ( rtw_switch_usb_mode )
```
  0 = no switch (default)
  1 = switch from usb 2.0 to usb 3.0
  2 = switch from usb 3.0 to usb 2.0
```
  Note: When changing USB options, a cold boot is recommended.


Log level options: ( rtw_drv_log_level )
```
  0 = NONE (default)
  1 = ALWAYS
  2 = ERRORS
  3 = WARNINGS
  4 = INFO
  5 = DEBUG
  6 = MAX
```
  Note: View RTW log entries by running the following in a terminal:
  ```
  $ sudo dmesg
  ```


LED control options: ( rtw_led_ctrl )
```
  0 = Always off
  1 = Normal blink (default)
  2 = Always on
```

### Information about USB 3 support:

USB 3 support is off by default as there can be problems with older USB 3 ports, however, almost all USB 3 ports on modern systems work well so turning USB 3 support on should work fine for almost everyone and the difference in performance can be large as can be seen in the data from the tests that I have conducted:


```
USB 3 support turned off (driver v5.8.7.2)
 (average Bitrate = 255 Mbits/sec)

Transfer     Bitrate
30.9 MBytes   260 Mbits/sec
29.5 MBytes   247 Mbits/sec
32.6 MBytes   273 Mbits/sec
30.6 MBytes   256 Mbits/sec
30.4 MBytes   255 Mbits/sec
28.3 MBytes   238 Mbits/sec
```

```
USB 3 support turned on (driver v5.8.7.2)
 (average Bitrate = 411 Mbits/sec)

Transfer     Bitrate
48.8 MBytes   409 Mbits/sec
47.5 MBytes   398 Mbits/sec
51.2 MBytes   430 Mbits/sec
48.8 MBytes   409 Mbits/sec
50.0 MBytes   419 Mbits/sec
47.5 MBytes   398 Mbits/sec
```

```
USB 3 support turned on (driver v 5.8.7.4)
 (average Bitrate = 552 Mbits/sec)

Transfer     Bitrate         Retr
66.2 MBytes   556 Mbits/sec    0
62.5 MBytes   524 Mbits/sec    0
67.5 MBytes   566 Mbits/sec    0
66.2 MBytes   556 Mbits/sec    0
65.0 MBytes   545 Mbits/sec    0
67.5 MBytes   566 Mbits/sec    0
```

See what your USB mode is:

```
$ lsusb -t
```
```
USB 2 =  480M
USB 3 = 5000M
```

### Entering Monitor Mode with 'iw' and 'ip':

Start by making sure the system recognizes the Wi-Fi interface:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

Note: The output shows the Wi-Fi interface name and the current mode among other things. The interface name may be something like `wlx00c0cafre8ba` and is required for the below commands. The interface name `wlan0` will be used in the instructions below but you need to substitute your interface name.

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```

Set monitor mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control
```

Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

### Reverting to Managed Mode with 'iw' and 'ip':

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```

Set managed mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set type managed
```

Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

### Packet Injection:

Install the `aircrack-ng` package:
```
$ sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
```
Open a terminal and execute the following:
```
$ sudo airmon-ng check kill
```
Determine the interface name:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```
Note: Do not use `airmon-ng` to enter Monitor Mode as it appears to be broken.

Note: Replace `wlan0` with your interface name.

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```
Set monitor mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control
```
Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```
Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```
Run a test:
```
$ sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0
```

Example of a successful test:
```
15:38:31  $ sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0
15:38:31  Trying broadcast probe requests...
15:38:31  Injection is working!
15:38:32  Found 1 AP

15:38:32  Trying directed probe requests...
15:38:32  8C:59:73:FE:8B:F5 - channel: 36 - 'APname'
15:38:32  Ping (min/avg/max): 0.826ms/4.058ms/6.667ms Power: -35.77
15:38:32  30/30: 100%
```

### Recommended Router Settings for WiFi:

Note: These are general recommendations based on years of experience but may not apply to your situation so testing to see if any help fix your problem is recommended.

Security: Use WPA2-AES. Do not use WPA or WPA2 mixed mode or TKIP.

Channel Width for 2.4G: Use 20 MHz. Do not use 40 MHz or 20/40 automatic.

Channels for 2.4G: Use 1 or 6 or 11. Do not use automatic channel selection.

Mode for 2.4G: Use G/N or B/G/N. Do not use N only.

Network names: Do not set the 2.4G Network and the 5G Network to the same name. Many routers come with both networks set to the same name.

Power Saving: Set to off. This can help in some situations. If you try turning it off and you see no improvement then set it back to on so as to save electricity.

After making these changes, reboot the router.


### Set regulatory domain to correct setting in OS:

Check the current setting:
```
$ sudo iw reg get
```

If you get 00, that is the default and may not provide optimal performance.

Find the correct setting here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

Set it temporarily:
```
$ sudo iw reg set US
```
Note: Substitute your country code if not the United States.

Set it permanently:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/default/crda

Change the last line to read:

REGDOMAIN=US
```
